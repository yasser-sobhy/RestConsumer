# RestConsumer
RestConsumer makes it very easy to write RESTful api consumers and to communicate with RESTful api servcies, see [QtSendGrid](https://github.com/yasser-sobhy/QtSendGrid/blob/master/src/sendgridclient.h) to see how to use it to consume write a web service.


RestConsumer is a part of [Gurra](https://github.com/yasser-sobhy/Gurra) ui framework.
